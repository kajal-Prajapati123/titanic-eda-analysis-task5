# Titanic EDA Analysis – Task 5

This project is part of an internship task to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Objective
The goal is to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset visually and statistically to uncover insights related to survival.

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Key Analyses & Visuals
- Age distribution of passengers
- Survival by Gender
- Boxplots for Age and survival
- Pairplot to observe feature relationships

---

## Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in Age and Embarked
- Dropped Cabin column due to high null count
- Verified with `.info()` and `.describe()`

---

## Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with complete analysis |
| `Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset.pdf` | PDF version of the report |
